# python-api-challenge
UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp module 6 python api challenge
The folder "Module-6-Challenge-Ashley_Canonizado" includes all of my necessary files needed for this assignment submission.
- "Module-6-Challenge-Ashley_Canonizado" includes two folders- "Code-Ashley_Canonizado" and "output_data".
- "Code-Ashley_Canonizado" includes two jupyter notebooks with my code- "VacationPy.ipynb" and "WeatherPy.ipynb"
    - "WeatherPy.ipynb" includes discussion on various graphs created from my code and responses from open weather apis within the last section of the notebook. 
    - "VacationPy.ipynb" includes tables and maps that include information based on the results of "WeatherPy.ipynb" and the response from geoapify.
- "output_data" includes all of the outputs from "WeatherPy.ipynb" which includes a 'cities.csv' file and various pngs of graphs made within the notebook. 

***All of the code within this challenge is either mine or provided by 'starter_code' when I first downloaded the assignment. I made use of Instructor help, as well as UCI Bootcampspot's Xpert Learning Assistant, and lastly various documentation (such as pandas and also the apis) to get help with fixing errors within my code and figuring out different ways to format my infographics.
